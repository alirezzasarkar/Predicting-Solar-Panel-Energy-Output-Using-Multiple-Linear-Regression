ðŸŒž Predicting Solar Panel Energy Output Using Multiple Linear Regression
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project builds a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict solar panel energy output based on:

    Temperature
    Solar Irradiance
    Wind Speed
    Humidity

The dataset is synthetically generated using a predefined linear relationship with added noise. The model is implemented using scikit-learn.
ðŸ“Š Dataset Description

The dataset contains 1000 samples, where:

    Temperature (Â°C): Randomly generated between 10 to 40Â°C.
    Solar Irradiance (W/mÂ²): Randomly generated between 300 to 1000 W/mÂ².
    Wind Speed (m/s): Randomly generated between 0 to 10 m/s.
    Humidity (%): Randomly generated between 10 to 90%.
    Energy Output (W): Calculated using a linear function with noise.

ðŸ“ˆ Model Evaluation

The model's performance is assessed using:
âœ… Mean Squared Error (MSE)
âœ… RÂ² Score
âœ… Visualization of predictions vs actual values
